To play a **tutorial**, you'll only need **Atom-CodeRoad**.

You can install Atom packages inside of Atom through the following menus: "Atom -> Preferences -> Install", and search for "atom-coderoad".

You may also choose to install *Atom Shell Commands* under the "Atom" menu. Shell commands allow you to quickly install Atom packages from the command line, for example: `> apm install atom-coderoad`.
