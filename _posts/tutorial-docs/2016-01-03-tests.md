Unit tests are used to determine:

* if a task passes or fails
* feedback a user gets when a test fails

Tests are loaded in their order from the tutorial markdown files, and concat together into one temporary file. This means that any import or require statements placed at the top of the first file will be shared by all tests for that page.

Tests should indicate which task they are, in order to quickly determine which task index has failed. For the *mocha-coderoad* test runner, this is as easy as adding the task number to describe block.

```js
describe('01 first task');
describe('04 fourth task');
```

### Test Statements

It makes sense to write test statements using 'should', 'must' or negative statements. Remember, the failing test message will be delivered as feedback to the user.

```js
it('should be a function')
it('must be a function')
it('isn\'t a function')
```
