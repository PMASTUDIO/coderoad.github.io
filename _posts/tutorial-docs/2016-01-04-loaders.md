Use a **loader** to run the user saved file in the context of your file. Think of a loader as a way to place the file your testing inside of your test file.

```js
// paths are prefixed with "BASE"
const userTextEditorContent = require('BASE/path/to/file');
const dataFile = require('BASE/path/to/data');
```

The keyword "BASE" will be over-ridden with an absolute path to the file.

*Note: When using spies, stubs or mocks, initiate them above your loader call.*


### Testing

If the editor exports a variable or function, units tests are easy to setup.

##### user file

```js
export const a = 1;
```

##### unit test

```js
expect(a).to.be(1);
```

Otherwise, there is a slightly more complicated way to test globals.

### Unit Tests with Globals

Running unit tests on globals requires two additional steps.

1. capture the file as a module
2. use a built-in `__get__` method to capture the target

##### user file

```js
const a = 1;
```

##### unit test

```js
// 1. capture the file's module.
// Note that BASE will be replaced with an absolute path to the project dir
const file = require('BASE/path/to/file.js');
// 2. use the __get__ method to capture the target variable
const a = filter.__get__('a');

expect(a).to.be(1);
```
