To create a **tutorial**, you'll need **Builder-CodeRoad**.

### Requirements

Builder CodeRoad has several key dependencies before starting:

* *NodeJS* > 0.10.x. Check your version with `> node -v`.
    - download a newer version [here](https://nodejs.org).
* *NPM* 3.x+. Check your version with `> npm -v`.
    - update with `> npm install -g npm`
* *Atom Editor*
    - available at [Atom.io](https://atom.io/)

### Install

You can install Atom packages inside of Atom through the following menus: "Atom -> Preferences -> Install", and search for "builder-coderoad".

You may also choose to install *Atom Shell Commands* under the "Atom" menu. Shell commands allow you to quickly install Atom packages from the command line, for example: `> apm install builder-coderoad`.

### Start

Toggle open *Builder-CodeRoad* using the *Packages* menu or press *ctrl-alt-9*.
